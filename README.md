# Testing In Android AppsðŸ“± 
## Benefits of Testing
Testing is an integral part of the app development process. By running tests against your app consistently, you can verify your app's correctness, functional behavior, and usability before you release it publicly.

You can manually test your app by navigating through it. You might use different devices and emulators, change the system language, and try to generate every user error or traverse every user flow.

## Organization of test directories
A typical project in Android Studio contains two directories that hold tests depending on their execution environment. Organize your tests in the following directories as described:
#### * AndroidTest
The androidTest directory should contain the tests that run on real or virtual devices. Such tests include integration tests, end-to-end tests, and other tests where the JVM alone cannot validate your app's functionality.

#### * Test
The test directory should contain the tests that run on your local machine, such as unit tests. In contrast to the above, these can be tests that run on a local JVM.

## Subject
There are different types of tests depending on the subject:
#### * Functional Testing 
Does my app do what it's supposed to?
#### * Performance Testing
Does it do it quickly and efficiently?
#### * Accessibility Testing
Does it work well with accessibility services?
#### * Compatibility Testing
Does it work well on every device and API level?

### Scope
  Tests also vary depending on size, or degree of isolation:

#### * Unit tests or (Small Test)
Tests only verify a very small portion of the app, such as a method or class.
#### * Integration Tests (Medium Test)
Are in between and check the integration between two or more units.
#### * Big tests 
Verify larger parts of the app at the same time, such as a whole screen or user flow.

## Unit Testing
Unit testing is a software testing approach where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure that each unit functions as intended. In the context of Android development, unit tests typically focus on testing specific methods, functions, or classes to verify their correctness. The goal is to identify and fix bugs early in the development process, enhance code maintainability, and support future changes.
Here some of unit testing frameworks commonly used for unit testing in android.
### * JUnit
JUnit is a widely adopted testing framework for Java that provides annotations and assertions for writing and running unit tests. It is a standard choice for structuring and executing unit tests in Java and Android development.
### * Mockito:
Mockito is a mocking framework that helps create mock objects for testing. It is widely used in Android development to isolate code under test by replacing real dependencies with mock objects. Mockito is often used in conjunction with JUnit.

## UI Testing
involves verifying the correct behavior of an application's user interface by simulating user interactions and ensuring that the UI elements respond as expected. It is a crucial aspect of app testing to guarantee a positive user experience and catch any issues related to the graphical interface. UI tests are typically broader in scope than unit tests, covering interactions across multiple components and ensuring the overall integration of the app's UI.

### * Espresso 

Espresso is a widely used UI testing framework for Android app development. It is part of the Android Testing Support Library and is designed to make writing and running UI tests for Android applications more efficient, reliable, and concise. Espresso is particularly well-suited for testing user interactions and ensuring that the app's user interface functions as expected.
